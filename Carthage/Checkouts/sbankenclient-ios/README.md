# SbankenClient.framework

An iOS framework to use the [Sbanken API](https://sbanken.no/bruke/utviklerportalen/).

The framework is offered as an example of API usage from Swift, as well
as a tool for quickly being able to create working iOS prototypes using
the API.

## Installation

### Using Carthage

The easiest way to get up and running is to add the framework using the
dependency manager [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

After installing Carthage, add the following to your
[Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

    github "Sbanken/sbankenclient-ios"

Run `carthage update` to build the dependencies.

Drag SbankenClient.framework from the Carthage/Build/iOS/ directory
to the Linked Frameworks and Libraries section of your Xcode projectâ€™s
General settings.

Add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SbankenClient.framework` to the
Input Files of your Carthage copy-frameworks build step as well as
`$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/SbankenClient.framework`
to the Output Files.

### Manual installation

This describes setting up a new simple app and including
SbankenClient.framework.

Clone this repository.

Create a new Workspace in Xcode (`File -> New -> Workspace...`).

Drag `SbankenClient.xcodeproj` into the left hand navigator of your new
workspace:

![Framework included in workspace](Docs/1-workspace-framework.png)

Add a new app project to your workspace by navigating to `File -> New ->
Project...`, selecting for instance a *Single View App*. Name your
project, and in the file dialog, make sure your new app is added to your
workspace:

![Add app project to workspace](Docs/2-add-project-to-workspace.png)

Lastly, select your new app project inside your workspace and drag
`SbankenClient.framework` into the `Embedded Binaries` area of the
project info view:

## Usage

Run a build of your Xcode project or workspace before attempting to use
the framework, and remember to `import SbankenClient` in every Swift
file you want to use the client from.

Create a new client by using your Client ID and Secret:

    let client = SbankenClient(clientId: "MY-CLIENT-ID", secret: "MY-SECRET")

(Sign up for [API access](https://sbanken.no/bruke/utviklerportalen/) if
you don't have these)

Let this client object live for as long as possible. It will handle
caching of the access token.

### Getting accounts

    client.accounts(userId: "[ELEVEN-DIGIT-ID]", success: { accounts in
        let acccountName = accounts.first?.name
        let availableAmount = accounts.first?.available
    }) { _ in
        print "An error occurred"
    }

### Getting transactions from an account

    let oneWeekAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -7, to: Date())!
    client.transactions(userId: "[ELEVEN-DIGIT-ID]", accountNumber: "[ACCOUNT-NUMBER]",
                        startDate: oneWeekAgo, endDate: Date(),
                        success: { response in
        let accountNumber = response.items.first?.accountNumber
        let amount = response.items.first?.amount
    }, failure: { _ in
        print("An error occurred")
    })

### Transferring an amount between two accounts within Sbanken

    client.transfer(userId: "[ELEVEN-DIGIT-ID]", fromAccount: "[ACCOUNT-NUMBER]", toAccount: "[ACCOUNT-NUMBER]",
                    message: "Here, have some money", amount: 100.0,
                    success: { response in
                        if (!response.isError) {
                            print("Transfer successful")
                        }
    }, failure: { _ in
        print("An error occurred")
    })
